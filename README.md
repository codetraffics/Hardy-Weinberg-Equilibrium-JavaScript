# Hardy-Weinberg-Equilibrium-JavaScript

> The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle stating that the genetic variation in a population will remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors.

## Allele frequencies
> f(A1) = p <br/>
> f(A2) = q <br/>

## Genotype frequencies
> f(A1A1) = p * p <br/>
> f(A2A2) = q * q <br/>
> f(A1A2) = (p * q) + (q * p) = 2pq <br/>
